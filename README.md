This repository contains the APK for my Turkic Keyboard App, an Android application that allows users to enable a custom keyboard with Turkic Runes.
The app is designed to help users write and understand Turkic Runes by providing both a functional keyboard and educational material about the runes.

Turkic Keyboard: Easily switch to a keyboard with Turkic Runes to type in this ancient script.
Reading and Writing Rules: The app includes a section where the Turkic Runes are listed, along with explanations of the reading and writing rules.

Use the keyboard in any app to type with Turkic Runes.
Explore the letters and rules section within the app to learn more about the alphabet and proper usage.
